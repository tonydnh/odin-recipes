      <li>1 tablespoon salt, divided</li>
      <li>2 gallons water</li>
      <li>2 medium onions, quartered</li>
      <li>1 (4 inch) piece fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>2 pounds beef oxtail</li>
      <li>1 white (daikon) radish, sliced</li>
      <li>2 ounces whole star anise pods</li>
      <li>½ (3 inch) cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black peppercorns</li>
      <li>2 whole cloves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds dried flat rice noodles</li>
      <li>½ pound frozen beef sirloin</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Make broth: Place beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot; season with 1 teaspoon salt. Pour water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer broth for about 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a 10x15-inch roasting pan with aluminum foil.</li>
      <li>Place onions and unpeeled ginger onto the prepared roasting pan and cook under the preheated broiler, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are charred, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Cool slightly. Chop onions, then peel and slice ginger; set aside separately.</li>
      <li>Skim fat from surface of simmering broth. Add oxtail, radish, and charred onions to broth. Tie charred ginger, anise, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, and cloves in cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni; add to broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Simmer over medium-low heat for at least 4 hours (the longer, the better). Season with salt.</li>
      <li>Strain broth. Discard bones and bouquet garni. Reserve meat from bones for another use. Chill broth in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
      <li>Skim and discard fat from the top of chilled broth. Pour broth into a pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve.</li>
      <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Turn off heat. Stir in rice noodles and let sit until noodles are tender yet chewy, 6 to 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, cut frozen sirloin into paper-thin slices.</li>
      <li>Drain and divide noodles among bowls, about 1 1/2 cups per serving. Top each with a few sirloin slices. Ladle hot broth over sirloin and noodles.</li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
